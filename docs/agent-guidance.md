# Agent guidance for session-optimizer

Read on demand by agents and routines; `CLAUDE.md` stays short and points here.

## CI contract for agents and routines

This section binds every agent that works on this repository: an interactive session,
a scheduled routine, the local manager. It follows the contract of `cdeust/Cortex`, the
source of truth for CI. Where the prompt of a routine is less restrictive, this section
wins: the prompt was written before the contract, and the repository's own standards
apply. It never widens what a prompt allows.

1. **The review verdict decides the merge.** The `PR Review` workflow posts a comment by
   `claude[bot]` that ends with `Verdict: approve` or `Verdict: block`. The resolver merges
   a pull request whose last verdict covers its head, reads approve, and whose required
   checks are green. Two cases differ: a Dependabot update the resolver classes as low risk
   (one commit signed by GitHub, minor or patch only, dependency manifests and lock
   files only, nothing under `.github/`) merges on green required checks without a
   review, and a title that contains "do not merge" is never merged. No
   agent merges by hand or enables auto-merge.
2. **Three reviews per pull request.** The budget counts the successful review runs of
   the pull request, so a push to an open pull request spends one. The `claude-rereview`
   label grants a fourth; it is the owner's to set, and the next push uses it. Push once
   per verdict, with every blocker of that verdict fixed, and never while a `PR Review`
   run is in progress on the pull request: the review would land on a commit that is no
   longer the head.
3. **Budget spent without an approve on the head: a new branch.** Push the same commits to
   `<branch>-r<N>`, open a pull request with the same title and body plus a "Continuation"
   section naming the old one, leave one "Continued in #n" line on the old one, close it.
   A forced push of any kind, `--force-with-lease` included, is never used: it does not
   reset the budget and it rewrites a branch another agent may hold.
4. **No comparison with the main branch.** Do not measure how far a branch is behind, do
   not rebase a pull request branch onto the main branch, do not use the branch-update
   button or its API, and do not write that a pull request is late: a late pull request
   merges. The only exception is a real conflict (`mergeable_state` is `dirty`): merge the
   main branch into the branch with a merge commit, resolve it, rerun the touched tests,
   check that the merge did not change the meaning of either side, and push normally.
5. **One pull request in flight.** A pull request is in flight while a check runs on it, a
   review runs on it, or an approve waits for the merge. While one is in flight, open no
   other pull request (issue, relaunch or next slice) and push to no other branch. A pull
   request under rule 7 is not in flight.
6. **No comment after an approve.** No reply to the notes, no summary, no acknowledgement.
   Notes marked "no action before merge" go to a follow-up pull request after the merge.
   Before an approve, comment only with a pushed fix, a hold, or the continuation line
   of rule 3. Never write a line that begins with `Verdict:`: that line is the review's.
7. **Owner decisions are left alone:** a pull request on the branch
   `ci/budget-counts-contract-reviews`, anything labelled `hold` or `do-not-merge`, a draft.
